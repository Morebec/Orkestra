# Domain Driven Design
Domain driven design is a set of tools used to manage software complexity. It provides guidelines
to help develop software in a way that is explicit and friendly to change.
In this section we will give a brief explanation of some core concepts of DDD that are recommended by Orkestra.

Domain Driven Design defines two important sets of concepts:
- **Strategic Concepts**: High-level concepts that are used to *design* an application and deepen a development team's
knowledge about the domain for which they need to develop a system.
- **Tactical Concepts**: Are low-level (close to the code) sets of practices that are used to 
put the strategic concepts in the context of actual code.

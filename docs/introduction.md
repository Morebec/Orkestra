# Introduction

Welcome to the Orkestra Documentation. Orkestra is an opinionated framework with a plethora of recommendations on architectural design
that we use internally at Mor√©bec to develop new products. It also provides technical tools to quickly create
products that are easy to maintain and scale.

Orkestra helps to build applications centered on the following core architectural concepts:
DDD (Domain Driven Design), CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), Event Sourcing and Event Driven Programming.

From a design point of view, Orkestra provides simple interfaces that can be implemented in any number of ways
to allow users of the framework to extend the functionality of the framework according to their needs.
It also provides a set of sensible default implementations for these interfaces.

Therefore, this documentation is divided into 2 main sections:
- [Core Concepts](./core_concepts/index.md) - Details the different core concepts of Orkestra that makes up its interface API.
- [Usage](usage/index.md) - This section describes the default implementation as well as their usages.
